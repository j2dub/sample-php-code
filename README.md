Sample PHP code.

File:  _showportfolio_preheader.php

Description:  Included php file for gathering information prior to page rendering for artist's profile pages on the web site "Handmade Michigan". The purpose of this code is to pull data for display within the header area of the rendered page. Public profile information, social media account(s), profile images are some of the types of data requested. Because artist profiles urls are displayed using their profile names for SEO reasons, this code prepares code of the rest of the page to pull and render other data for the artist profile.
